Write a java(POJO) application which reads from a file (file.txt). The file has the contents in the format given below and the same to be inserted in the database. There should be a unique thread for each department which processes entries from that department.

Assume that the table name is 'Employees' and the database name is 'development'. Create the table if it does not exist.

empid	empname	deptname
101	kumar	finance
102	harry	finance
103	peter	accounts
104	jimmy	accounts
Note: Two threads should be there : 1 thread for finance and other for accounts. Assume that finance and accounts would be the only departments.
